# Project Overview

The **ts-playground** is a meticulously structured learning environment that guides experienced backend developers from TypeScript fundamentals to production-ready applications through progressive, hands-on exercises and real-world implementations. This comprehensive guide outlines everything you need to know about the project.

## Educational Architecture

The learning pathway follows a four-stage progression model designed for developers with backend experience:

### Stage 1: TypeScript Foundations
- **Type System Mastery**: Understanding primitive types, advanced generics, conditional types, and mapped types
- **Core Language Features**: Variables, functions, classes, modules, and error handling with type safety
- **Project Configuration**: Comprehensive `tsconfig.json` setup and module resolution
- **Development Tooling**: Integration with linters, formatters, and IDEs for optimal development experience

### Stage 2: Command-Line Interface Development
- **CLI Architecture**: Building robust command-line tools using frameworks like Commander.js or Yargs
- **System Integration**: File system operations, process management, and environment configuration
- **Package Publishing**: Workflow for publishing npm packages and global tool installation
- **User Experience**: Interactive prompts, colored output, and intuitive command structures

### Stage 3: Backend API Development
- **API Design**: RESTful service architecture with type-safe request/response handling
- **Database Integration**: ORM integration (TypeORM, Prisma) with comprehensive type mapping
- **Security Implementation**: Authentication, authorization, and data validation patterns
- **Testing Strategies**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing approaches

### Stage 4: Production Deployment & Optimization
- **Deployment Strategies**: Containerization with Docker and cloud deployment patterns
- **Performance Optimization**: Profiling, caching, and resource management techniques
- **Observability**: Logging, monitoring, and alerting implementation
- **Quality Assurance**: CI/CD pipelines, code coverage, and automated testing

## Learning Methodology

This project emphasizes a **learn-by-doing** approach where theoretical concepts are immediately applied through practical exercises. Each stage increases in complexity and requires integration of knowledge from previous stages.

## Technology Ecosystem

**Core Technologies:**
- **TypeScript**: Primary language with strict type checking enabled
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for backend applications
- **Express/Fastify**: Web framework options for API development

**Development Tools:**
- **ESLint**: Code quality and style enforcement
- **Prettier**: Automated code formatting
- **Jest**: Testing framework for comprehensive coverage
- **Husky**: Git hooks for quality assurance
- **Tsx/TS-Node**: Direct execution of TypeScript files

**Deployment & Operations:**
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipelines
- **Production Logging**: Pino or Winston for application monitoring
