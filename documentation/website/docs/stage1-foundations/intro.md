# Stage 1: TypeScript Foundations

Welcome to the TypeScript Foundations stage of ts-playground. This stage establishes the essential building blocks for professional TypeScript development, focusing on type safety, code organization, and development tooling mastery.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this stage, you will master:

**Type System Mastery:**
- Primitive and complex type definitions with strict compilation settings
- Interface and type alias design for scalable applications
- Advanced type manipulation including generics, conditional types, and mapped types
- Union and intersection type patterns for robust type modeling

**Professional Development Fundamentals:**
- TypeScript project configuration with `tsconfig.json` optimization
- Integration with development tooling (ESLint, Prettier, editors)
- Module systems and import/export patterns for scalable architectures
- Error handling and validation strategies with custom error types

**Code Organization & Architecture:**
- File and directory structure following professional conventions
- Function design with proper typing for parameters and return values
- Class implementation with access modifiers, inheritance, and interfaces
- Testing fundamentals for TypeScript applications

## Professional Skills Development

This stage emphasizes industry-standard practices:

- **Type Safety**: Implementing strict, reliable type systems that prevent runtime errors
- **Code Quality**: Following established conventions and standards for maintainable code
- **Tool Integration**: Leveraging TypeScript's ecosystem for enhanced developer experience
- **Architecture Planning**: Designing scalable, maintainable code structures

## Stage Structure

The Foundations stage is organized into progressive modules:

1. **Basic Types & Syntax**: Core TypeScript syntax and primitive type systems
2. **Complex Types**: Advanced type operations, interfaces, and generics
3. **Module Systems**: ES Module patterns and project organization
4. **Development Tooling**: Integration with professional tooling and workflows
5. **Testing Fundamentals**: Unit testing with TypeScript-specific patterns

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this stage, ensure you have:
- Node.js 18+ and npm 9+ installed
- Familiarity with JavaScript fundamentals
- A code editor with TypeScript support configured

## Getting Started

Begin with the basic type system exercises and progress systematically through each module. Each exercise builds upon previous concepts while introducing new professional development patterns. Follow the exercises in sequence to establish a solid foundation for subsequent stages.

The exercises in this stage prepare you for advanced TypeScript development by establishing rigorous coding standards and professional development practices from the outset.

Continue with the exercises to begin mastering TypeScript's powerful type system.
