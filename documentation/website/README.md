## Contributing to Documentation

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

The documentation is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch, using the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml`.
