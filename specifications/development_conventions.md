# Development Conventions

While this is primarily a learning documentation repository, the outlined learning path implies best practices for TypeScript development:

- Prioritizing strong typing and leveraging TypeScript's advanced type system.
- Structuring projects progressively, from simple scripts to layered backend applications.
- Utilizing Node.js as the primary runtime environment for executing and testing TypeScript code.
- Employing modern tooling like `tsx` or `ts-node` for rapid development and testing without manual compilation steps.
- Following standard project structures for Node.js/TypeScript applications (e.g., separation of concerns into routes, services, models).
