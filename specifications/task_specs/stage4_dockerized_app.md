# Implementation Plan: Dockerized Application

## Task Overview

Containerize a TypeScript application using Docker. This exercise will demonstrate how to create a Docker image for a TypeScript application, optimize the image for production, and run the containerized application.

## Requirements Analysis

Based on Stage 4 learning objectives, this exercise should demonstrate:

- Containerization concepts with Docker
- Multi-stage Docker builds for TypeScript applications
- Dockerfile optimization for production
- Environment variable configuration
- Container orchestration basics
- Production deployment considerations

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Project Structure

```
stage4-production/exercises/dockerized-app/
├── package.json           # Exercise-specific dependencies
├── README.md              # Exercise documentation
├── Dockerfile             # Docker image definition
├── .dockerignore          # Files to exclude from Docker context
├── docker-compose.yml     # Docker Compose configuration (optional)
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts           # Application entry point
│   └── app.ts             # Core application logic
├── tests/
│   └── app.test.ts        # Application tests
└── tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration
```

### 2. Core Components

#### app.ts

- Implement a simple but complete application:
  - Example: A REST API server with a few endpoints
  - Or: A CLI tool that can run as a service
  - Or: A background processing service
- Include proper error handling and logging
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Export application functionality

#### index.ts

- Serve as the main entry point for the application
- Parse environment variables
- Initialize the application
- Handle graceful shutdown
- Start the application server or service

#### Dockerfile

- Implement a multi-stage Docker build:
  - Builder stage:
    - Use Node.js Alpine image as base
    - Copy package files and install dependencies
    - Copy source code and compile TypeScript to JavaScript
  - Production stage:
    - Use Node.js Alpine image as base
    - Copy compiled JavaScript and declaration files from builder stage
    - Copy package.json and install production dependencies only
    - Create non-root user for security
    - Expose appropriate port
    - Define entry point and command
- Optimize for security and performance:
  - Use non-root user
  - Minimize layers
  - Exclude unnecessary files with .dockerignore
  - Use appropriate health checks

#### .dockerignore

- Exclude files and directories from Docker context:
  - node_modules/
  - dist/
  - tests/
  - .git/
  - .github/
  - .vscode/
  - \*.md (except README.md if needed)
  - .env
  - .gitignore
  - .npmrc
  - Dockerfile
  - docker-compose.yml

#### docker-compose.yml (Optional)

- Define multi-container setup if needed:
  - Application service
  - Database service (if applicable)
  - Any other dependent services
- Configure environment variables
- Define networks and volumes if needed

#### package.json

- Configure scripts for Docker workflow:
  - build: Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
  - start: Run the application
  - dev: Run the application in development mode
- Define appropriate dependencies and devDependencies

### 3. Technical Requirements

- Use strict TypeScript mode with all strict options enabled
- Implement proper error handling with TypeScript's type system
- Follow Docker best practices
- Use multi-stage builds to minimize image size
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement health checks
- Use non-root user for security
- Use ES Module syntax for imports/exports
- Include comprehensive JSDoc comments for exported functions and interfaces

### 4. Docker Configuration

- Multi-stage build process:
  - Build stage with development dependencies
  - Production stage with only runtime dependencies
- Image optimization:
  - Use Alpine Linux base images for smaller size
  - Clean up temporary files and caches
  - Minimize number of layers
- Security considerations:
  - Run as non-root user
  - Use specific versions of base images
  - Scan for vulnerabilities
- Environment configuration:
  - Support for PORT environment variable
  - Support for other configurable parameters
  - Default values for all environment variables

### 5. Testing Plan

- Test Docker image build process
- Test containerized application functionality
- Test environment variable configuration
- Test health checks
- Test multi-container setup (if using Docker Compose)
- Verify image size and security
- Target: 100% success rate for Docker operations
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) for tests

### 6. Quality Assurance

- All code must pass ESLint and Prettier checks
- All tests must pass with 100% success rate
- README.md must include:
  - Description of the Dockerized application
  - How to build the Docker image
  - How to run the containerized application
  - How to run tests
  - Environment variable documentation
  - Docker Compose usage (if applicable)
  - Security considerations

### 7. Dependencies

- Express or Fastify for web framework (if building an API)
- Jest for testing framework
- ts-jest for TypeScript testing support
- TypeScript compiler
- Docker for containerization
- Docker Compose (optional)

## Implementation Steps

1. Create project structure directories
2. Initialize package.json with required dependencies
3. Implement core application logic in src/app.ts
4. Implement application entry point in src/index.ts
5. Create application tests in tests/app.test.ts
6. Write Dockerfile with multi-stage build
7. Create .dockerignore file
8. Create docker-compose.yml (optional)
9. Write comprehensive README.md documentation
10. Verify Docker image builds successfully
11. Test containerized application functionality
12. Verify all tests pass
13. Ensure code meets TypeScript strict mode requirements
14. Validate ESLint and Prettier compliance

## Success Criteria

- Docker image builds successfully with multi-stage process
- Containerized application runs correctly
- Environment variables are properly configured
- Image is optimized for security and performance
- All tests pass with 100% success rate
- Code follows all TypeScript coding standards
- README.md provides clear Docker documentation with examples
