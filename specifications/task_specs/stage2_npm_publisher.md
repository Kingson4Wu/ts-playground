# Implementation Plan: Publishing a Simple CLI Tool to npm

## Task Overview

Create a simple CLI tool and publish it to npm. This exercise will demonstrate the complete workflow of creating, packaging, and publishing a TypeScript-based CLI tool to the npm registry, including proper package configuration, documentation, and distribution.

## Requirements Analysis

Based on Stage 2 learning objectives, this exercise should demonstrate:

- Complete CLI tool development workflow
- npm package configuration and publishing
- TypeScript project configuration for distribution
- Documentation best practices
- Version management and semantic versioning
- Package bundling for distribution

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Project Structure

```
stage2-cli/exercises/npm-publisher/
├── package.json           # Package configuration for npm
├── README.md              # Package documentation
├── tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration for distribution
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts           # Entry point for CLI
│   └── tool.ts            # Core tool logic
├── tests/
│   └── tool.test.ts       # Unit tests
├── dist/                  # Compiled output directory
└── bin/
    └── cli-tool           # CLI executable script
```

### 2. Core Components

#### tool.ts

- Implement a simple but useful CLI tool functionality:
  - Example: A text analysis tool that counts words, characters, and lines in text
  - Or: A simple file utility that performs common file operations
  - Or: A development utility like a simple HTTP server or file watcher
- Define appropriate interfaces and types for the tool's functionality
- Implement core logic with proper TypeScript typing
- Include error handling and validation
- Export functions using named exports

#### index.ts

- Serve as the main entry point for the CLI tool
- Use commander or yargs for CLI argument parsing
- Implement help documentation with examples
- Call the core tool functions with parsed arguments
- Handle errors gracefully and display user-friendly messages
- Output results to console appropriately

#### bin/cli-tool

- Simple executable script that runs the compiled TypeScript tool
- Should use node to execute the compiled JavaScript
- Proper shebang line for cross-platform execution

#### package.json

- Configure package for npm publishing:
  - name: Unique package name (e.g., @username/simple-cli-tool)
  - version: Starting version (1.0.0)
  - description: Clear description of the tool
  - keywords: Relevant keywords for discoverability
  - author: Author information
  - license: MIT license
  - bin: Point to the CLI executable script
  - main: Point to the main module entry point
  - types: Point to TypeScript definition files
  - files: Specify which files to include in the package
  - scripts: Build, test, and prepublish scripts
  - dependencies: Runtime dependencies only
  - devDependencies: Development dependencies
  - repository: Link to source repository
  - homepage: Link to documentation
  - bugs: Link to issue tracker

#### tsconfig.json

- TypeScript configuration optimized for library distribution:
  - Target modern JavaScript (ES2020 or later)
  - Module system: CommonJS for Node.js compatibility
  - Declaration files generation enabled
  - Strict TypeScript settings
  - Output directory configuration

### 3. Technical Requirements

- Use strict TypeScript mode with all strict options enabled
- Implement proper error handling with TypeScript's type system
- Follow naming conventions (kebab-case for files, camelCase for variables)
- Include comprehensive JSDoc comments for exported functions and interfaces
- Use ES Module syntax for imports/exports in source code
- Generate CommonJS modules for npm distribution

### 4. Testing Plan

- Unit tests for the core tool functionality
- Test cases for all supported operations
- Test cases for error conditions
- Test cases for edge cases
- Target: 100% test coverage for core logic
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) for tests

### 5. Quality Assurance

- All code must pass ESLint and Prettier checks
- All tests must pass with 100% success rate
- README.md must include:
  - Clear description of the tool
  - Installation instructions
  - Usage examples with command-line examples
  - API documentation if applicable
  - License information
  - Contribution guidelines
- Package.json must be properly configured for npm publishing
- Dist directory must contain compiled JavaScript and declaration files

### 6. Publishing Workflow

1. Create npm account if needed
2. Configure package.json with proper metadata
3. Build the project (compile TypeScript to JavaScript)
4. Test the compiled package locally
5. Create npmignore file to exclude unnecessary files
6. Publish to npm registry using `npm publish`
7. Verify package is available on npm
8. Test installation and usage via `npx`

### 7. Dependencies

- commander or yargs for CLI argument parsing
- Use built-in Node.js modules
- Jest for testing framework
- ts-jest for TypeScript testing support
- TypeScript compiler for building
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality

## Implementation Steps

1. Create project structure directories
2. Initialize package.json with proper configuration for npm publishing
3. Implement the core tool logic in src/tool.ts
4. Create unit tests in tests/tool.test.ts
5. Implement the CLI interface in src/index.ts
6. Create the executable script in bin/cli-tool
7. Configure tsconfig.json for distribution
8. Write comprehensive README.md documentation
9. Verify all tests pass
10. Build the project (compile TypeScript)
11. Test the compiled package locally
12. Ensure package is properly configured for npm
13. Publish to npm registry

## Success Criteria

- CLI tool has useful functionality and works correctly
- Package is properly configured for npm publishing
- All unit tests pass with 100% success rate
- Package can be successfully published to npm
- Package can be installed and used via `npx`
- Code follows all TypeScript coding standards
- Documentation is comprehensive and clear
