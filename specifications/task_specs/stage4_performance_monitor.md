# Implementation Plan: Performance Monitoring Tool

## Task Overview
Create a performance monitoring tool that can track and report on application performance metrics. This tool should demonstrate observability concepts, logging, and performance measurement in a TypeScript application.

## Requirements Analysis
Based on Stage 4 learning objectives, this exercise should demonstrate:
- Performance monitoring and observability concepts
- Logging best practices with structured logging
- Performance measurement techniques
- Metrics collection and reporting
- Integration with monitoring libraries
- Production-ready tooling

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Project Structure
```
stage4-production/exercises/performance-monitor/
├── package.json           # Exercise-specific dependencies
├── README.md              # Exercise documentation
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts           # Tool entry point
│   ├── monitor.ts         # Core monitoring logic
│   └── logger.ts          # Logging utilities
├── tests/
│   └── monitor.test.ts    # Tool tests
└── tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration
```

### 2. Core Components

#### logger.ts
- Implement structured logging utility:
  - Use pino or winston for logging
  - Support different log levels (trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
  - Structured JSON logging for production
  - Pretty printing for development
  - Configurable log level via environment variables
- Implement logging functions:
  - trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal
- Export logger instance and functions

#### monitor.ts
- Implement performance monitoring functionality:
  - Measure function execution time
  - Track HTTP request/response times (if applicable)
  - Monitor memory usage
  - Monitor CPU usage
  - Track event loop delay
  - Collect garbage collection statistics
- Implement metrics collection:
  - Counter metrics (e.g., request count)
  - Gauge metrics (e.g., memory usage)
  - Histogram metrics (e.g., response times)
- Implement reporting functionality:
  - Periodic metrics reporting to console
  - Metrics aggregation
  - Formatted output for different environments
- Implement monitoring decorators or higher-order functions:
  - @timed decorator for measuring function execution
  - withMonitoring wrapper for wrapping async operations
- Export monitoring functions and classes

#### index.ts
- Serve as the main entry point for the monitoring tool
- Demonstrate usage of the monitoring tool
- Provide CLI interface if applicable
- Configure monitoring based on environment variables
- Handle graceful shutdown and final metrics reporting

### 3. Technical Requirements
- Use strict TypeScript mode with all strict options enabled
- Implement proper error handling with TypeScript's type system
- Use pino or winston for structured logging
- Follow observability best practices
- Use ES Module syntax for imports/exports
- Include comprehensive JSDoc comments for exported functions and interfaces
- Implement proper type definitions for metrics and monitoring data

### 4. Monitoring Features
- Performance metrics collection:
  - Function timing
  - Memory usage
  - CPU usage
  - Event loop delay
- Metrics reporting:
  - Periodic console reporting
  - Aggregated metrics
  - Formatted output
- Monitoring utilities:
  - Decorators for automatic timing
  - Higher-order functions for wrapping operations
  - Context tracking for requests/operations
- Configuration:
  - Environment-based configuration
  - Customizable reporting intervals
  - Configurable metrics collection

### 5. Testing Plan
- Unit tests for monitoring functions
- Test cases for metrics collection
- Test cases for logging functionality
- Test cases for performance measurement
- Test cases for error conditions
- Test cases for edge cases
- Mock system metrics for testing
- Target: 100% test coverage for monitoring logic
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) for tests

### 6. Quality Assurance
- All code must pass ESLint and Prettier checks
- All tests must pass with 100% success rate
- README.md must include:
  - Description of the performance monitoring tool
  - How to use the monitoring tool
  - How to run tests
  - Configuration options documentation
  - Example usage with code snippets
  - Metrics reporting documentation
  - Performance considerations

### 7. Dependencies
- pino or winston for logging
- Jest for testing framework
- ts-jest for TypeScript testing support
- TypeScript compiler
- @types/node for Node.js type definitions

## Implementation Steps
1. Create project structure directories
2. Initialize package.json with required dependencies
3. Implement logging utilities in src/logger.ts
4. Implement core monitoring logic in src/monitor.ts
5. Create tool entry point in src/index.ts
6. Create tool tests in tests/monitor.test.ts
7. Write comprehensive README.md documentation
8. Verify all tests pass
9. Ensure code meets TypeScript strict mode requirements
10. Validate ESLint and Prettier compliance

## Success Criteria
- Performance monitoring tool correctly collects metrics
- Proper logging with structured data
- Accurate performance measurements
- Configurable reporting options
- All tests pass with 100% success rate
- Code follows all TypeScript coding standards
- README.md provides clear documentation with examples
