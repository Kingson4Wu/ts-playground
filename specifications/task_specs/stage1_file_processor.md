# Implementation Plan: File Content Processing Script

## Task Overview

Create a command-line script that processes text files to perform operations like counting words, lines, characters, finding patterns, or transforming text (e.g., converting case, removing whitespace). The script should demonstrate file system operations and text processing in TypeScript.

## Requirements Analysis

Based on Stage 1 learning objectives, this exercise should demonstrate:

- Asynchronous file system operations using fs/promises
- Working with Node.js built-in modules (fs, path)
- String manipulation and regular expressions
- Error handling for file operations
- Command-line argument parsing
- Union types for operation selection

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Project Structure

```
stage1-foundations/exercises/file-processor/
├── index.ts               # Entry point for CLI
├── file-processor.ts     # Core file processing logic
├── file-processor.test.ts # Unit tests
└── README.md            # Exercise documentation
```

### 2. Core Components

#### file-processor.ts

- Define OperationType union type: `'count-words' | 'count-lines' | 'count-chars' | 'find-pattern' | 'to-upper' | 'to-lower' | 'remove-whitespace'`
- Define FileProcessorOptions interface with:
  - filePath: string
  - operation: OperationType
  - pattern?: string (required for find-pattern operation)
- Implement processFile function:
  - Parameters: options object implementing FileProcessorOptions interface
  - Return type: Promise<string | number> (depending on operation)
  - Use fs/promises for asynchronous file operations
  - Implement all operations:
    - count-words: Count words in the file
    - count-lines: Count lines in the file
    - count-chars: Count characters in the file
    - find-pattern: Find occurrences of a pattern (regex) in the file
    - to-upper: Convert file content to uppercase
    - to-lower: Convert file content to lowercase
    - remove-whitespace: Remove extra whitespace from file content
  - Handle file reading errors appropriately
  - Validate operation parameters (e.g., pattern required for find-pattern)
- Export the types and function using named exports

#### index.ts

- Parse command-line arguments using `process.argv`
- Convert arguments to FileProcessorOptions object
- Validate input arguments with type checking
- Handle help flag (-h, --help) to display usage information
- Call the processFile function with parsed options
- Handle errors gracefully and display user-friendly messages
- Output results to console (or write to file for transformation operations)

### 3. Technical Requirements

- Use strict TypeScript mode with all strict options enabled
- Implement proper error handling with TypeScript's type system
- Use Node.js built-in fs/promises module for asynchronous file operations
- Follow naming conventions (kebab-case for files, camelCase for variables)
- Include comprehensive JSDoc comments for exported functions and interfaces
- Use ES Module syntax for imports/exports

### 4. Testing Plan

- Unit tests for the processFile function with various operations
- Test cases for all operation types
- Test cases for error conditions (file not found, invalid operations)
- Test cases for edge cases (empty files, files with special characters)
- Mock file system operations for testing
- Target: 100% test coverage for core logic
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) for tests

### 5. Quality Assurance

- All code must pass ESLint and Prettier checks
- All tests must pass with 100% success rate
- README.md must include:
  - Description of the exercise
  - How to run the file processor
  - How to run tests
  - Available operations and their usage
  - Example usage

### 6. Dependencies

- No external dependencies required
- Use built-in Node.js modules only (fs, path)
- Jest for testing framework

## Implementation Steps

1. Create project structure directories
2. Implement the core file processing logic in file-processor.ts
3. Create unit tests for file-processor.ts
4. Implement the CLI interface in index.ts
5. Write comprehensive README.md documentation
6. Verify all tests pass
7. Ensure code meets TypeScript strict mode requirements
8. Validate ESLint and Prettier compliance

## Success Criteria

- File processor correctly performs all specified operations
- Proper error handling for file operations and invalid inputs
- Asynchronous file operations work correctly
- All unit tests pass with 100% success rate
- Code follows all TypeScript coding standards
- README.md provides clear instructions for usage and testing
