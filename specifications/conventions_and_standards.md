# Important Conventions and Standards

- **Language Standard**: TypeScript with ES2022 target
- **Build Tool**: TypeScript Compiler (tsc) with tsx for development
- **Development Environment**: Cross-platform (Mac/Windows/Linux) + Node.js
- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js
- **Documentation Standards**: 
  - Each executable exercise must contain README.md with compilation, running, and usage instructions
  - Each implementation file must contain usage instructions
  - Test files need to include instructions on how to run tests
- **Development Standards**:
  - All code comments and documentation must be in English
  - Do not commit code changes to Git unless explicitly instructed by the user
  - Before executing any task, output a specific implementation plan and wait for user confirmation before proceeding
- **Quality Assurance**:
  - Write unit tests to verify core functionality
  - Use code coverage tools to ensure test quality (target coverage > 80%)
  - Unit tests must be written in the specified directory according to project standards
  - After each task is completed, all unit tests must be verified to pass successfully as a validation point
  - Verify unit tests are successful by running `npm test` and checking for test pass output
  - Projects must be able to successfully execute `tsc` for compilation
