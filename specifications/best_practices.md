# Notes and Best Practices

1. Use TypeScript's type system to catch errors at compile time
2. Write unit tests to verify core functionality
3. Use code coverage tools to ensure test quality (target coverage > 80%)
4. Follow the established project structure for consistency
5. Document all public APIs and complex logic
6. Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style
