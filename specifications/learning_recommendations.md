# Learning Recommendations

1. **Progressive Learning**: Follow the stage order for learning, each stage's exercises have specific learning objectives
2. **Hands-on Practice**: Not only read the code, but also implement and debug it yourself
3. **Focus on Type Safety**: While implementing functionality, pay attention to leveraging TypeScript's type system
4. **Test-Driven**: Write unit tests for key functionality to ensure code quality
5. **Code Quality**: Use ESLint and Prettier to maintain consistent code style
