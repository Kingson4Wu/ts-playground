# Project Overview

This directory, `ts-playground`, is a dedicated learning and experimentation space for mastering TypeScript (TS), specifically tailored for developers with existing backend experience. The primary goal is to provide a structured pathway to learn TypeScript fundamentals and apply them to practical scenarios like building command-line interfaces (CLIs) and backend services using Node.js.

The core of this project is a comprehensive, multi-stage learning plan detailed in the `README.md` file. This plan guides the learner through:
1.  **Foundations:** Understanding core TypeScript syntax, types, and concepts.
2.  **CLI Development:** Creating and publishing command-line tools with Node.js and TypeScript.
3.  **Backend Development:** Building type-safe RESTful APIs and interacting with databases using Node.js frameworks.
4.  **Production Readiness:** Covering performance optimization, deployment (e.g., Docker), and essential development tooling (linting, formatting).

This repository functions as a documentation hub and a conceptual blueprint for TypeScript learning rather than a collection of runnable application code.
