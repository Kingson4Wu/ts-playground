# Directory Structure Planning

Each stage directory contains:

- `tsconfig.json`: Stage-specific TypeScript configuration
- `package.json`: Stage-specific dependencies (if needed)
- `exercises/`: Contains all practice exercises for that stage
- `practice/`: Playground for experimentation

Each exercise follows a consistent structure:

- `src/`: Source code
- `tests/`: Test files
- `package.json`: Exercise-specific dependencies
- `README.md`: Exercise documentation
