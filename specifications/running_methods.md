## Exercise Development

Each exercise can be developed independently:

1. Navigate to the exercise directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run development server: `npm run dev`
4. Run tests: `npm test`

## Quality Assurance

Before submitting any changes, ensure all quality checks pass:

1. All tests pass: `npm test`
2. Code formatting is correct: `npm run format:check`
3. Project builds successfully: `npm run build`
4. Code passes linting checks: `npm run lint`

All of these checks must pass before considering any task complete.
