# Task Completion Acceptance Criteria

This document defines the acceptance criteria that must be met for any task to be considered complete.

## Core Requirements

Every task must satisfy the following acceptance criteria before it can be considered complete:

### 1. Test Verification
- All tests must pass: `npm test`
- Test coverage must meet quality standards (> 80% where applicable)
- All test cases must execute successfully without failures

### 2. Code Formatting
- Code must pass formatting checks: `npm run format:check`
- All files must comply with Prettier formatting standards
- No formatting errors or warnings should be present

### 3. Build Verification
- Project must build successfully: `npm run build`
- No compilation errors should be present
- All TypeScript files must compile without errors

### 4. Linting Compliance
- Code must pass linting checks: `npm run lint`
- No ESLint errors or warnings should be present
- Code must follow established coding standards

## Validation Process

Before marking any task as complete, the following validation steps must be performed:

1. Run all tests: `npm test`
2. Check code formatting: `npm run format:check`
3. Verify project builds: `npm run build`
4. Run linting checks: `npm run lint`

All of these commands must execute successfully with no errors.

## Special Cases

Some tasks may have additional acceptance criteria specific to their domain. These will be documented in the task specification files.

## Failure Handling

If any of the acceptance criteria fail:
1. The task must not be marked as complete
2. Issues must be identified and resolved
3. All acceptance criteria must be re-validated after fixes
4. Only then can the task be considered complete

## Documentation

Upon task completion:
1. Update the TODO.md file to mark the task as complete
2. Ensure all relevant documentation is updated
3. Verify that all acceptance criteria are clearly documented
